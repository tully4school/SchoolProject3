# Crypto v10
This project was fun and simple. First time ever using an API and really got the chance to dig into it since there are so many options. I have many ideas for this but with the time constraints what you see is what you get for now. The site is fully responsive and updates the choices of cryptocurrency based on the top ten on the market at any given time. Values are updated every 30 seconds thanks to [nomics.com](www.nomics.com).

## Getting Started
You will have to have this program running on your localhost due to the fact that a key was needed for this API. They did offer a free version but ONLY if run on a localhost. 
1. Clone The File
2. Open your terminal to the cloned directory
3. Create an http-server
4. Open the file via your localhost8080

## Codebase Used
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Javascript ES6

## API Information
The API was found at [nomics.com](www.nomics.com), who allowed me to use a free key for the purpose of this school project. Thanks to everyone at nomics.com!
